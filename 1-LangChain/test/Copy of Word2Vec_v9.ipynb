Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one, and survived.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zFq8yH2k7XKd"},"source":["# Step2.Create Train and Test Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YJ7dkbj16bL9","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714394106981,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5646,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Reddy Konasani (Venky)","userId":"11388081409849462561"}},"outputId":"c2f79dc1-a7b0-4189-e640-cf0944b034ba"},"source":["shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(train_dir, 'unsup')) # Removing 'unsup' folder.

But it does have its amusing moments, and it is very deft in its execution. The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations actually carry the story.

From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity captured within human life (and yet the overal simplicity of humanity). Although the film is slow-moving, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any ideas, but allows the ideas to come about themselves, it allows the concepts to reveal themselves.<br /><br />The film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins, and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes that we make. It is a look into everyday life, very well and beautifully done.<br /><br />If you are looking for action or for intense drama, this is not the film for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original, and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz, this is a great film to watch.'\n","Label 1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-HGqDdoy8DuZ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714394106981,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Reddy Konasani (Venky)","userId":"11388081409849462561"}},"outputId":"ab336f7c-b38d-4d64-cc78-cc6cc12c44b9"},"source":["for text_batch, label_batch in test_datagen.take(1):\n","  for i in range(5):\n","    print(\"Review\", text_batch.numpy()[i])\n","    print(\"Label\", label_batch.numpy()[i])"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Review b\"POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br /><br />The Spy Who Shagged Me is a muchly overrated and over-hyped sequel. International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.<br /><br />OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.<br /><br />In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.<br /><br />The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.<br /><br />If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour. So I say, only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one ultimate disappointment.\"\n","Label 0\n","Review b\"Colorful western.<br /><br />Wyoming cowboy James Stewart moseys on up to the Yukon Territory to dig for gold, sell his steers, and try to get a date with pretty saloon-owner Ruth Roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff John McIntire who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by William Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International, directed by Anthony Mann.<br /><br />Also starring Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist, and Walter Brennan as Stewart's sidekick.\"\n","Label 1\n","Review b\"Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. It was great..the film wasn't long enough..I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that..I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.\"\n","Label 1\n","Review b\"This one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It's an episodic multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest, who live in a city literally made from garbage. Though it looks like an A-Bomb just hit, the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing, but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When not searching for food, they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house. An emotionally moving and beautiful film.\"\n","Label 1\n","Review b'A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions. The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house, or was it from a lover\\'s apartment? Rogers actually has two identities at the film\\'s outset, that of Miss Terry, the dead victim\\'s secretary, along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan. Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand (Talbot) instead of her paper\\'s rewrite desk, she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he\\'s been out scooped.<br /><br />Here\\'s a puzzle - it\\'s revealed during Police Inspector Russell\\'s (Purnell Pratt) investigation of Harker\\'s death that Terry/Morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks. Why exactly was that? After the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story, but before? Clues are dropped regarding Harker\\'s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building, but again, that association isn\\'t relevant until it\\'s all linked up to janitor Peterson (Harvey Clark). And who\\'s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS, with the words \"You will hear it\" cut and pasted beneath? Apparently, the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house\\'s radiator system, which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims, such as Mrs. Coby in the apartment below Harker. But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs. Coby\\'s death, he replied \"apparently\" to the cause of strangulation.<br /><br />It\\'s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me. The revelation of janitor Peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of Miss Morgan in the building\\'s incinerator furnace! However, and score another point against continuity, we see Miss Morgan in a huge basement room as Peterson ignites the furnace; she made her getaway, but how? And still pretty as a picture. And who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant Wilfred (Arthur Hoyt), who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room.<br /><br />Sorry, but for all those reviewers who found \"A Shriek in the Night\" to be a satisfying whodunit, I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable \"The Usual Suspects\" by comparison. If you need a reason to see the film, it would be Ginger Rogers, but be advised, she doesn\\'t dance.'\n","Label 0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w9grAWLa9o5U"},"source":["# Step3.Data Pre-processing - Also known as \"standardizing\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O_U5zGkl91k_"},"source":["*   Remove punctuation\n","*   Remove HTML tags\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bj4wllLY9MJd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714394106981,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Reddy Konasani (Venky)","userId":"11388081409849462561"}}},"source":["def pre_process(input_data):\n","  lowercase = tf.strings.lower(input_data)\n","  stripped_html = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercase, '<br />', ' ')  #Remove HTML tags like <br />\n","  return tf.strings.regex_replace(stripped_html,\n","                                  '[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation),  #Remove HTML links\n","                                  '')"],"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sOFkqnuJ-5ZW"},"source":["# Step4.Mapping words to numbers - Also known as TextVectorization"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dJYAHjVr-R5K","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714394109612,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2633,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Reddy Konasani (Venky)","userId":"11388081409849462561"}},"outputId":"dc19b5ca-49b0-4358-bff3-7c144ad9c0b3"},"source":["vocab_size = 20000    #Limiting the maximum vocab size in the overall data. take only top frequent words\n","max_sequence_length = 250 #Limiting the maximum length of input sequence of words in a single review\n","\n","vectorize_layer = TextVectorization(\n","    standardize=pre_process,\n","    max_tokens=vocab_size,\n","    output_sequence_length=max_sequence_length # Truncate large sequences or pad with '0' if the sequence is short\n","    )\n","\n","# Define \"vectorize_text\" function to create the sequnce of integers\n","train_text = train_datagen.map(lambda x, y: x) # Take only x data, reviews only ; ignore y data - lables\n","vectorize_layer.adapt(train_text) #Adapt function used to convert the index of strings to integers.\n","\n","def vectorize_text(text, label):\n","  text = tf.expand_dims(text, -1) #One extra dimention will be added at the end.
